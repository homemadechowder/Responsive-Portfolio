## About
This assignment is making our website responsive to screen size changes given 980px, 768px, and 640px. I modified each element to fit the exact width given by the assignment. One of the tricks I used is to set the background a different color for each width so I can easily tell which is which for troubleshooting. Getting a hang of this assignment wasn't easy to begin with but once it gets rolling it becomes more apparent what is needed to change. Redo-ing the header bar for 640px was one of the first challenges I've faced. I added a 640p only bar to put About | Portfolio | Contacts and adjusted the margins and placements of these 3 link items to fit description.

## Portfolio

I re-implemented clearfix and float for this page in different sizes simply because my original code wasn't particularly sustainable to changes. I made specific modifications for 768 and 980px to made the images line up correctly. 640 was done much easily because all I had to do was to stretch the items to fill the screen.

## Contact

The contacts page was the simplest page for this assignment once more. The original implementation was able to withstand size changes quite nicely.
